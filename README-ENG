**🎯General Goal**

Analyze user behavior within the application to identify bottlenecks in the conversion funnel and determine whether a change in typography significantly impacts conversion rates.

**🧩Methodology**

 - Data Cleaning and Preparation
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Event Funnel Analysis
 - A/A/B Test Analysis

**☘️Expected Results**

 - A clear map of the conversion funnel with drop-off rates at each stage.
 - Confirmation that the two control groups are statistically indistinguishable (validating the experimental design).
 - A definitive conclusion on whether the font change has a statistically significant effect (positive or negative) on user behavior and conversion rates.
 - Data-driven recommendations on whether to implement the new fonts across the entire application.

**📑Obtained Results**

 - Recommendation to investigate the reason for the difference in conversion rates between experimental and control values.
 - Recommendation to ensure equal group sizes for experimental and control groups.
