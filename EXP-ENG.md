# AAB Testing and Sales Funnel Analysis
This project involves analyzing user behavior data for a food startup's mobile application, focusing on two main objectives: understanding the sales funnel performance and evaluating the impact of a font design change through A/A/B testing methodology.
Key Project Components
1. Sales Funnel Analysis
Objective: Investigate user behavior patterns and identify conversion bottlenecks

User Journey Mapping: Track how users progress through different stages of the purchase process
Conversion Rate Analysis: Calculate the percentage of users reaching the final purchase stage
Drop-off Identification: Determine which stages lose the most users and analyze retention rates
Stage-by-Stage Performance: Measure conversion rates between consecutive funnel stages

2. A/A/B Testing Implementation
Objective: Evaluate the impact of new font design on user engagement and conversions

Test Design: Three-group experimental setup:

Group A1 (Control): Original fonts (Experiment ID 246)
Group A2 (Control): Original fonts (Experiment ID 247)
Group B (Treatment): New fonts (Experiment ID 248)


Control Group Validation: Verify that both control groups show similar behavior patterns
Statistical Analysis: Compare treatment group performance against control groups

3. Data Analysis Methodology
Data Preparation & Exploration

Data Structure: Event-based logging system with user identifiers and timestamps
Data Quality Assessment: Handle missing values, verify data types, and ensure data completeness
Temporal Analysis: Identify reliable data collection periods and exclude incomplete data ranges
User Segmentation: Ensure balanced representation across all experimental groups

Statistical Testing Framework

Event Frequency Analysis: Rank events by occurrence and user participation rates
Hypothesis Testing: Conduct statistical significance tests for group comparisons
Multiple Testing Correction: Address potential false positives from multiple hypothesis tests
Significance Level Optimization: Determine appropriate alpha levels for reliable conclusions

4. Key Performance Metrics

Event Distribution: Frequency and user participation rates for each action type
Funnel Conversion Rates: Stage-by-stage user progression analysis
End-to-End Conversion: Overall percentage of users completing the full purchase journey
Group Performance Comparison: Statistical differences between experimental groups
Treatment Effect Size: Quantify the impact of font changes on user behavior

5. Expected Deliverables

Comprehensive Funnel Report: Detailed analysis of user drop-off points and conversion optimization opportunities
A/A/B Test Results: Statistical evidence for font design decision-making
Experimental Validation: Confirmation of proper randomization and control group similarity
Actionable Recommendations: Data-driven insights for product and design teams

Technical Skills Demonstrated

Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing, significance testing, and experimental design
Data Processing: ETL operations, data cleaning, and temporal analysis
Funnel Analytics: Conversion rate optimization and user journey analysis
A/B Testing: Experimental design, control group validation, and treatment effect measurement
Data Visualization: Creating histograms, funnel charts, and comparative analysis plots

Business Impact
This analysis provides critical insights for strategic decision-making regarding user experience optimization and design changes, enabling data-driven product development and improved conversion rates.
